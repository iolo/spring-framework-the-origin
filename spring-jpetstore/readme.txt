THE SPRING JPETSTORE (May 2004)
-------------------------------
http://www.springframework.org


Sample application for "J2EE Development without EJB",
by Rod Johnson and Juergen Hoeller (Wiley, 2004).

The Spring JPetStore is an adapted version of Clinton Begin's JPetStore (http://www.ibatis.com).
It leverages Spring's support for the iBATIS SQL Maps to improve the original JPetStore in terms of
internal structure and wiring. On top of a Spring-managed middle tier, it offers two alternative web
tier implementations: one using Spring's web MVC plus JSTL, and one using Struts 1.1 plus JSTL.


This JPetStore release is the version that is shipped with the Spring Framework release 1.0.1.
It is a direct excerpt from the Spring distribution, to be able to reuse the same build script.
The actual sample application can be found in "samples/jpetstore", with its own readme file.

For the most up-to-date JPetStore version, download the most recent Spring Framework release
(http://www.springframework.org).
